# my-arch-linux-setup
This repo used to be for for storing my notes, snipets, scrips that I have accumulated over the time of using arch linux on a daily basis while developing code. 
ranging from cli tools, to compose files.

I have split a few into their own repos:

## Notes/Wiki:
https://github.com/LeanderZiehm/wiki

## configurations/dotfiles: 
https://github.com/LeanderZiehm/dotfiles

## devops
https://github.com/LeanderZiehm/devops
